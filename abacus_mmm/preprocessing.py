  """Class to scale your data based on multiplications and divisions.

  This scaler can be used in two fashions for both the multiplication and
  division operation.
  - By specifying a value to use for the scaling operation.
  - By specifying an operation used at column level to calculate the value
    for the actual scaling operation.

  Eg. if one wants to scale the dataset by multiply by 100 you can directly
  pass multiply_by=100. Value can also be an array with as many values
  as column has the data being scaled. But if you want to multiply by the mean
  value of each column, then you can pass multiply_operation=jnp.mean (or any
  other operation desired).

  Operation parameters have the upper hand in the cases where both values and
  operations are passed, values will be ignored in this case.

  Scaler must be fit first in order to call the transform method.

  Attributes.
    divide_operation: Operation to apply over axis 0 of the fitting data to
      obtain the value that will be used for division during scaling.
    divide_by: Numbers(s) by which to divide data in the scaling process. Since
      the scaler is applied to axis 0 of the data, the shape of divide_by must
      be consistent with division into the data. For example, if data.shape =
      (100, 3, 5) then divide_by.shape can be (3, 5) or (5,) or a number. If
      divide_operation is given, this divide_by value will be ignored.
    multiply_operation: Operation to apply over axis 0 of the fitting data to
      obtain the value that will be used for multiplication during scaling.
    multiply_by: Numbers(s) by which to multiply data in the scaling process.
      Since the scaler is applied to axis 0 of the data, the shape of
      multiply_by must be consistent with multiplication into the data. For
      example, if data.shape = (100, 3, 5) then multiply_by.shape can be (3, 5)
      or (5,) or a number. If multiply_operation is given, this multiply_by
